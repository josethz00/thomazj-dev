Do you remember set theory? A math topic that you probably learned in elementary school, revisited in high school, and 
then never again? Well, it's time to revisit it. Relational Algebra is a formal language based on set theory, and it's
purpose is to query and manipulate data.

## Why do I need to know this?

Relational Algebra is the basis for SQL, the main language used in relational databases. Relational Algebra can also have
some applications in NoSQL databases. If you want to understand how databases work "under the hood", you need to know
the main concepts of Relational Algebra.

## What is Relational Algebra?

Relational algebra is a declarative language for querying and manipulating data. As SQL, you just specify which data you
want, what conditions it should satisfy, and how it should be transformed (grouped, sorted, aggregated, etc). The database
engine will take care of the rest, so you don't have to worry about how the data is stored, nor how to access it.

In the image above, we have a woman who wants to order a pizza. She doesn't know how to make a pizza, she doesn't know
how to cook it, she doesn't know how to deliver it. She just knows what she wants, and she knows how to ask for it. The
waiter is the SQL/Relational Algebra engine, he is an interface between the woman and the chef. The chef is the database
engine, he understands the order passed by the waiter, and he knows how to make the pizza.

Declarative query languages usually hide the implementation details from the user. This is a good thing, because it allows
the database engine to optimize the query execution, and it also allows the user to focus on the data, not on the
algorithm required to access it.

### SQL analogy

How to order a pizza in SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pizza
WHERE size = 'large'
AND flavor = 'pepperoni';
```

How to order a pizza in Relational Algebra:

$$
pizzas = \sigma_{size = "large" \space \space \wedge \space \space flavor = "pepperoni" }(pizza)
$$

## Relational Algebra Operations

Ted Codd, a mathematician and computer scientist, proposed eight operations for Relational Algebra. These operations are:

<b>
- Selection ($\sigma$)
- Projection ($\pi$)
- Cartesian Product ($\times$)
- Union ($\cup$)
- Difference ($-$)
- Join ($\bowtie$)
- Division ($\div$)
- Intersection ($\cap$)
</b>

Before we dive into the details of each operation, let's define our dataset. We will use a simple dataset with three tables:

### Table 1: Players

| id | name | email | phone | countryId |
|----|------|-------|-------|-----|
| 1  | Lionel Messi | leomessi@afa.com | +54 9111234-5678 | 1 |
| 2  | Cristiano Ronaldo | cr7@siii.pt | +351 912345-678 | 2 |
| 3  | Pele | pele@goat.br | +55 91234-5678 | 3 |
| 4  | Diego Maradona | maradona@afa.com | +54 911234-5678 | 1 |

### Table 2: Countries

| id | name | code |
|----|------|------|
| 1  | Argentina | AR |
| 2  | Portugal | PT |
| 3  | Brazil | BR |

### Table 3: Teams

| id | name | countryId |
|----|------|------------|
| 1  | Barcelona | 1 |
| 2  | Juventus | 2 |
| 3  | Vasco da Gama | 3 |
| 4  | Boca Juniors | 1 |
| 5  | Real Madrid | 1 |
| 6  | Benfica | 2 |
| 7  | Santos | 3 |
| 8  | River Plate | 1 |
| 9  | Newells Old Boys | 1 |

### Selection ($\sigma$)

The selection operation is used to filter the rows of a table. It is represented by the symbol $\sigma$.

$$
\sigma_{condition}(table)
$$

The condition is a boolean expression that must be satisfied by the rows of the table. The result of the selection is a new (SET)
table with only the rows that satisfy the condition.

#### Example

Let's say we want to select all the players from Argentina. We can do that with the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM players
WHERE countryId = 1;
```

The equivalent query in Relational Algebra is:

$$
\sigma_{countryId = 1}(players)
$$

The result of the selection is a new table with only the players from Argentina:

| id | name | email | phone | countryId |
|----|------|-------|-------|-----|
| 1  | Lionel Messi | leomessi@afa.com | +54 9111234-5678 | 1 |
| 4  | Diego Maradona | maradona@afa.com | +54 911234-5678 | 1 |

### Projection ($\pi$)

Instead of selecting rows, like the selection operation, the project operation selects columns. It is represented by the symbol $\pi$. This operation
allows us to filter the columns of a table.

$$
\pi_{columns}(table)
$$

The columns argument is a list of column names. The result of the projection is a new table with only the columns specified in the columns argument.

#### Example

Projection is very useful when we want to select only a few columns from a table. Let's say we want to select the name and email of all the players.

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM players;
```

The equivalent query in Relational Algebra is:

$$
\pi_{name, email}(players)
$$

The result of the projection is a new table with only the name and email columns:

| name | email |
|----|------|
| Lionel Messi | leomessi@afa.com |
| Cristiano Ronaldo | cr7@siii.pt |
| Pele | pele@goat.br |
| Diego Maradona | maradona@afa.com |

We can also combine the selection and projection operations. Let's say we want to select the name and email of all the players from Argentina.

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM players
WHERE countryId = 1;
```

The equivalent query in Relational Algebra is:

$$
\pi_{name, email} \space (\sigma_{countryId = 1}(players))
$$

In the expression above, we first apply the projection operation, to specify which columns we want to be returned by the query.
Then, we apply the selection operation, to filter the rows of the table, containing only argentinian players.

### Union ($\cup$)
